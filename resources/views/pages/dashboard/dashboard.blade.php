                Hell there!  I want you to let you know about the test project. The project is very huge for a full time developer who handles a test in his/her part-time. Because We should handle the layout, model, the migrations and the controller and If you assume this can be finished in a week from scratch, I donâ€™t think this is possible. 
Thank You Anyway
